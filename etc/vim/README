============
VIM ctafonf
============


Setup:
======

You'll need a fairly recent version of vim for everything to work.
(and the support of python in vim ...)

You'll need to have exuberant-ctags installed to stop having vimrc
complaining at start up.


Random notes:
============


I'll try to keep the correct file system hierarchy for vim scripts,
so the vimrc itself is  quite small

The various plugins are versionned as they were when I downloaded them,
and some of them are patched, so do not expect to have the latest
version of every plugins.


If you wish to change settings for a particular language, please use
vim/ftplugin/<language>.vim, NOT vimrc.

Non-standard behavior:
 - virtualedit in "block" mode

There is support for profiles, too.
You can put your favorite stuff to
.config/ctafconf/profile/<name>/vimrc

general
-------

* Use rope for python completion like emacs

  right now)
